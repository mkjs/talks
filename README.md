# MKJS Talks

A repo for organising talk proposals / topic suggestions and discussing talks with speakers

## Talk Format

- Each event has 3 speaker slots available.  
- Each talk is allocated 20 minute, however this can be altered on a per-case basis.

## How
It's simple. [Open an issue](https://github.com/mkjs/talks/issues/new) to submit a talk.  

Please structure the issue as following:

- Title: [Talk Title]
- Body: [Abstract of your talk]

If you are looking for feedback on your talk or have additional questions, reply to your issue with  **extra comments** stating your questions but please keep them off the body of the original issue text itself.

### Please conform to the issue structure so that we can use the api to automate some of the event admin.

## Confirmation
- Once your issue is assigned a milestone, it has been approved and confirmed.  
- Check the milestone date for confirmation of the event date.

## After the event
Please tweet a url to your slides

Thanks,
MKJS
